Description:
The main goal of the project was to implement the existing UI for the Windows Phone using HTML5 technologies.

Features:
  - Communicating with a restful API to download and upload data.
  - using phone native hardware features to take pictures, and save data
  - multipage responsive design

Outcome:
 - the project itself was a success but unfortunately Melodigram couldn't keep its success and at the end the whole app wasn't continued.

 How to run:
   - The project needs to be compiled using Cordova. unfortunately the server is not up any more so the app won't work.
